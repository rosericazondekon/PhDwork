    % The following are examples of how to word your thanks
    
    First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Susan McRoy for the continuous support of my Ph.D study, for her patience, motivation, and immense knowledge. Her guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this dissertation.
    
    I would also like to offer my special thanks to Dr Charles Welzig and the Welzig Neuroscience and Neurotechnology lab at the Medical College of Wisconsin. I benefited from the computational resource available in the lab to run the analyses and the computational intensive simulations. My thanks also go to Zachary James Harper for his availability. Without his precious support it would not be possible to conduct this research.
    
    My special thanks are extended to Dr Spencer (Chiang Ching) Huang of the Joseph Zilber School of Public Health. He has been crucial to the successful continuation of my PhD journey at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. He provided me an opportunity to join, and who gave access to the laboratory and research facilities.
    
    Finally, I would like to thank the rest of my thesis committee: Prof Christine Cheng, and Dr. Rohit Kate, and Dr. Zhang Qing, for their insightful comments, encouragement, and crucial recommendations and suggestions which widen my research from various perspectives.
