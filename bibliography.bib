  abstract = {Introduction: In an economy geared to innovation and competitiveness in research and development activities, inter-relationships between the university, private enterprise and government are of considerable interest. Networking constitutes a priority strategy to attain this strategic objective and a tool in knowledge-based economies. Method: Drawing from a full inventory of co-authored scientific articles, collaborating networks are defined and analysed with the social network analysis method, using Pajek software and graphed with the Kamada-Kawai algorithm for visualization. Analysis: Scientific production involving intraregional collaboration in the Madrid region is analysed across three subject categories. The data used were taken from the Web of Science for the years 1995-2003. The main indicators of social networking obtained were: density average degree, normalized degree and degree centralization, betweenness centralization, closeness centralization and clustering coefficient. Results: Networking led to a moderate rise in the number of links and participating actors, with more Spanish companies and multi-national subsidiaries in the second period. The largest number of links was recorded for public universities located in the Community of Madrid. Conclusions: The data resulting from the social network analysis conducted provided insight into the structural characteristics of the networks generated and their evolution. The visualization methodology used proved to be highly informative for identifying not only the main actors, but clusters and components as well. The analysis afforded a useful perspective for understanding the dynamics of collaborating networks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The co-authorship among members of a research group commonly can be represented by a (co-authorship) graph in which nodes represent the researchers that make up of this group and edges represent the connections between two agents (i.e., the co-authorship between these agents). Current study measures the reliability of networks by taking into consideration unreliable nodes (researchers) and perfectly reliable edges (co-authorship between two researchers). A Bayesian approach for the reliability of a network represented by the co-authorship among members of a real research group is proposed, obtaining Bayesian estimates and credibility intervals for the individual components (nodes or researchers) and the network. Weakly informative and non-informative prior distributions are assumed for those components and the posterior summaries are obtained by Monte Carlo-Markov Chain methods. The results show the relevance of an inferential approach for the reliability of scientific co-authorship network. The results also demonstrate that the contribution of each researcher is highly relevant for the maintenance of a research group. In addition, the Bayesian methodology was a feasible and easy computational implementation.},

  title = {Complex {{Network Analysis}} for {{Scientific Collaboration Prediction}} and {{Biological Hypothesis Generation}}},
  abstract = {With the rapid development of digitalized literature, more and more knowledge has been discovered by computational approaches. This thesis addresses the problem of link prediction in co-authorship networks and protein--protein interaction networks derived from the literature. These networks (and most other types of networks) are growing over time and we assume that a machine can learn from past link creations by examining the network status at the time of their creation. Our goal is to create a computationally efficient approach to recommend new links for a node in a network (e.g., new collaborations in co-authorship networks and new interactions in protein--protein interaction networks).

We consider edges in a network that satisfies certain criteria as training instances for the machine learning algorithms. We analyze the neighborhood structure of each node and derive the topological features. Furthermore, each node has rich semantic information when linked to the literature and can be used to derive semantic features. Using both types of features, we train machine learning models to predict the probability of connection for the new node pairs.

We apply our idea of link prediction to two distinct networks: a co-authorship network and a protein--protein interaction network. We demonstrate that the novel features we derive from both the network topology and literature content help improve link prediction accuracy. We also analyze the factors involved in establishing a new link and recurrent connections.},

  title = {Learnable Similarity Functions and Their Application to Record Linkage and Clustering},
  abstract = {Many machine learning and data mining tasks depend on functions that estimate similarity between instances. Similarity computations are particularly important in clustering and information integration applications, where pairwise distances play a central role in many algorithms. Typically, algorithms for these tasks rely on pre-defined similarity measures, such as edit distance or cosine similarity for strings, or Euclidean distance for vector-space data. However, standard distance functions are frequently suboptimal as they do not capture the appropriate notion of similarity for a particular domain, dataset, or application.
In this thesis, we present several approaches for addressing this problem by employing learnable similarity functions. Given supervision in the form of similar or dissimilar pairs of instances, learnable similarity functions can be trained to provide accurate estimates for the domain and task at hand. We study the problem of adapting similarity functions in the context of several tasks: record linkage, clustering, and blocking. For each of these tasks, we present learnable similarity functions and training algorithms that lead to improved performance.
In record linkage, also known as duplicate detection and entity matching, the goal
is to identify database records referring to the same underlying entity. This requires estimating similarity between corresponding field values of records, as well as overall similarity between records. For computing field-level similarity between strings, we describe two learnable variants of edit distance that lead to improvements in linkage accuracy. For learning record-level similarity functions, we employ Support Vector Machines to combine similarities of individual record fields in proportion to their relative importance, yielding a high-accuracy linkage system. We also investigate strategies for efficient collection of training data which can be scarce due to the pairwise nature of the record linkage task.
In clustering, similarity functions are essential as they determine the grouping of
instances that is the goal of clustering. We describe a framework for integrating learnable similarity functions within a probabilistic model for semi-supervised clustering based on Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRFs). The framework accommodates learning various distance measures, including those based on Bregman divergences (e.g., parameterized Mahalanobis distance and parameterized KL-divergence), as well as directional measures (e.g., cosine similarity). Thus, it is applicable to a wide range of domains and data representations. Similarity functions are learned within the HMRF-KMEANS algorithm derived from the framework, leading to significant improvements in clustering accuracy.
The third application we consider, blocking, is critical in making record linkage
and clustering algorithms scalable to large datasets, as it facilitates efficient selection of approximately similar instance pairs without explicitly considering all possible pairs. Previously proposed blocking methods require manually constructing a similarity function or a set of similarity predicates, followed by hand-tuning of parameters. We propose learning blocking functions automatically from linkage and semi-supervised clustering supervision, which allows automatic construction of blocking methods that are efficient and accurate. This approach yields computationally cheap learnable similarity functions that can be used for scaling up in a variety of tasks that rely on pairwise distance computations, including record linkage and clustering.},

  abstract = {We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known community detection method in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad-hoc modular networks.},

  title = {Scientific {{Authorship}} and {{Collaboration Network Analysis}} on {{Malaria Research}} in {{Benin}}: Papers Indexed in the {{Web Of Science}} (1996-2016)},
  volume = {(article under review)},
  abstract = {Background: To sustain the critical progress made, prioritization and a
multidisciplinary approach to malaria research remain important to the national
malaria control program in Benin. To document the structure of the malaria
collaborative research in Benin, we analyze authorship of the scientific documents
published on malaria from Benin from January 1996 to December 2016.
Methods: We collected bibliographic data from the Web Of Science on malaria
research in Benin from January 1996 to December 2016. From the collected data,
a mulitigraph co-authorship network with authors representing vertices was
generated. An edge was drawn between two authors when they co-author a
paper. We computed vertex degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvectors
among others to identify prolific authors. We further assess the weak points and
how information flow in the network. Finally, we perform a hierarchical clustering
analysis, and Monte-Carlo simulations
Results: Overall, 427 publications were included in this study. The generated
network contained 1792 authors and 116,388 parallel edges which converted in a
weighted graph of 1792 vertices and 95,787 edges. Descriptive analyses suggested
that prolific authors with higher degrees tend to collaborate more. The
hierarchical clustering revealed 23 clusters or research groups, 7 of which form a
giant component containing 94\% of all the vertices in the network. Closer
attention to this giant component showed that it has all the characteristics of a
small-world network with a small shortest path distance between pairs of 3, a
diameter of 10 and a high clustering coe?cient of 0.964. Though, Monte-Carlo
simulations suggested our observed network is an unusual type of small-world
network. A cut vertex analysis of the network revealed the presence of 16 vertices
as weak points.
Conclusion: The malaria research collaboration network in Benin is a complex
network that seems to display the characteristics of a small-world network (often
referred to as six degrees of separation). This research reveals the presence of
closed research groups where collaborative research likely happens only between
members. Interdisciplinary collaboration tends to occur at higher levels between
prolific researchers. Advanced analyses involving statistical modeling are needed
to better explain the malaria co-authorship network in Benin.},

One perspective is found in the work of physicists and mathematicians who formally introduced the small world model and the mechanism of preferential attachment. The other perspective is sociological and focuses on the process of cumulative advantage and considers the agency of individual actors in a network. We test hypotheses, based on work drawn from these perspectives, regarding the structure and dynamics of scientific collaboration networks. The data we use are for four scientific disciplines in the Slovene system of science. The results deal with the overall topology of these networks and specific processes that generate them. The two perspectives can be joined to mutual benefit. Within this combined approach, the presence of small-world structures was confirmed. However preferential attachment is far more complex than advocates of a single autonomous mechanism claim.},

  volume = {251},
  issn = {0021-9258},
  abstract = {Active transport of pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine occurs in resting cells of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228 and can lead to intracellular concentrations of free vitamin much higher than those supplied externally. The initial Km for pyridoxine uptake is 3.6 x 10(-7) M at 30 degrees and pH 4.5, which are optimum for growth. Transport is inhibited by many unphosphorylated vitamin analogs, the most effective being 5'-deoxypyridoxine, 5'-deoxypridoxal, toxopyrimidine, 4'-deoxypyridoxine, and 3-amino-3-deoxypyridoxine. Two distinct uptake systems that differ in structural specificity and ionic requirements are present. One, with optimum pH of 3.5, transports pyridoxal effectively, but not pyridoxamine; the other (optimum pH 6.0) transports pyridoxamine effectively, but not pyridoxal. Both systems transport pyridoxine, while neither transports pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Other properties of these systems are similar, indicating that they share certain elements in common. An initial temperature optimum of 30 degrees is observed for pyrodoxine transport and, at this temperature, an "overshoot" in intracellular vitamin levels, with subsequent decrease to a constant level, occurs with time. It appears that intracellular vitamin, or a derivative, activates the exit mechanism for the vitamin. Exit rates also depend on the resuspension buffer and are increased in the presence of glucose and decreased by azide. Above 30 degrees net uptake of pyridoxine drops initially, then rapidly increases to a second optimum at 50 degrees; the uptake system is inactivated at about 55 degrees. The optimum at 50 degrees apparently results from activation of inflow as exit is rapid and is accelerated by azide. No overshoot was detected at 50 degrees, so it appears that the exit system is not regulated by intracellular vitamin at this temperature. A phase transition in membrane lipids occurs at 30 degrees and may be responsible for the change in properties of the inflow and exit mechanisms above this temperature.},

Two indicators, namely publications and citations, were analysed to establish the patterns of knowledge co-production and its scientific impact, respectively. The study found that knowledge production through collaborative research among sub-Saharan African countries is minimal and contributes only a small percentage when compared to collaboration between sub-Saharan African countries and their foreign counterparts. Similarly, the scientific impact of international collaboration was higher than that of continental collaboration. Countries belonging to the same geographic region contributed to each other's knowledge production more frequently than they did to the countries outside their region. It is recommended that, for knowledge co-production in sub-Saharan Africa to improve, various measures such as encouraging student and staff exchange, hosting more regional conferences and encouraging research networks need to be put in place.},
