In this dissertation, we have documented and described the collaborative pattern in Malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB research in Benin. 
Since co-authorship networks are dynamic in nature, the application of temporal or dynamic modeling techniques is the major strength of our research. Other strengths include its application of not only descriptive methods but also robust network analysis methods such as inferential methods like Monte-Carlo simulations, unlike most studies on co-authorship analysis. Our data mining strategy involved a robust machine learning algorithm that helped address the crucial issue of the disambiguation of authors names and assign a unique identification to each of them. This technique maintained a good quality of the data collected throughout the pre-processing and analysis steps. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to describe the malaria research collaborations network via co-authorship network analysis in Benin. It is also the first to apply statistical network models to investigate co-authorship network in a specific research area in an African country.\\%~\\
Our first approach to modeling our network relied on the use of SBM. In addition of being a model based clustering method, the SBM identified important organizational and interactional patterns in the network. It is worth noting that many of the studies on co-authorship network analysis are descriptive in nature. This study is one of the rare co-authorship network analysis to model a co-authorship network using advanced statistical models. ERGM is the leading approach to modeling network \cite{schmid_exponential_2017}. The literature has reported application of this model in studying various social network such as the analysis of friendship and obesity \cite{valente_adolescent_2009,de_la_haye_obesity-related_2010}, the exploration of the association between hormone and social network structure \cite{kornienko_hormones_2014}. Similarly to friendship networks, the use of ERGM to model co-authorship networks is easily justified. However, the size of our network prevented the fitting of complex models including dyadic and structural terms. In addition, our best model failed to adequately fit the observed network data. This lack of goodness-of fit, according to Hunter, Goudreau and Handcock \cite{hunter_goodness_2008}, could be improved by including the geometrically weighted edgewise shared partner, geometrically weighted dyadic shared partner, and geometrically weighted degree network statistics to our model. Although, we follow such recommendations by including these structural network statistics to our final model, the ERGM model failed to converge after a maximum of 1,000 iterations. Furthermore, at about 750 iterations, we notice that the processing became both computationally intensive and expensive in terms of CPU time and memory usage.  In a recently published paper, Schmid and Desmarais \cite{schmid_exponential_2017} acknowledged the difficulty of fitting network which size is of the order 1,000 vertices using ERGM. They recommended that using the maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE) instead of the Monte Carlo maximum likelihood (MCMLE) could tremendously reduce computation time. Having followed these recommendations too, the model containing dyadic and structural terms still failed to converge. Let's recall that our weighted co-authorship network contains 1,792 vertices for 95,707 edges. We suspect that the number of edges, the large size of the network added to the possibility of hidden/latent variables might justify the failure of the final model containing the dyadic and structural terms to converge. We remedy this situation by applying LNM to the observed network data. \\
The fact that we collected data only from the Web Of Science can be considered as an important limitation of this study. However, according to Falagas and colleagues \cite{falagas_comparison_2007}, who compared PubMed, Scopus, Web Of Science and Google Scholar in their paper, the Web Of Science appears as a reasonable scientific database source for our analysis. In addition, it proved to cover a wide range of both old and recently published papers. Falagas and colleagues \cite{falagas_comparison_2007} found PubMed to be the optimal choice in terms of scientific database. For that reason we did run the same bibliographic search in PubMed. Unfortunately, the Web Of Science returns more relevant data than PubMed. Another limitation worth noting is that this study only looks at a snapshot of the malaria research network on a static fashion. There is also a need to apply dynamic statistical models such as Temporal Exponential Random Graph \cite{leifeld_temporal_2015} and Dynamic Stochastic Block \cite{matias_statistical_2016} modeling to better understand the temporal dynamic of collaboration formation in this network. Yet another limitation is inherent to the nature of all co-authorship studies. Collaborators, in a co-authorship network, do not often come from the same scientific discipline, or do not play the same roles on a particular research project. The data we collected did not allow us to accurately assess or even infer the disciplines each author came from or their specific contribution in the published document.
